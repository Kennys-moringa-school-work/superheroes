# # POWERFUL HEROES:
# # Once you set up your tables and associations the way you want them, you can
# # uncomment the following method to associate superheroes with a superpower!
# # Just uncomment line 33 and run `rake db:seed` again in your terminal.
# # (Note: If you try to do this before you set up proper associations, it will error.)

# # heroes = heroes.map { |hero| hero.merge( { power_id: Power.all.sample.id } ) }

# heroes.each { |hero| Hero.create(hero) }

# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
